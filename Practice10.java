Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

 

Example 1:

Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:

Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 51.25%Submissions: 87K+Points: 2
Given an infinite supply of each denomination of Indian currency { 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 2000 } and a target value N.
Find the minimum number of coins and/or notes needed to make the change for Rs N. You must return the list containing the value of coins required. 


Example 1:

Input: N = 43
Output: 20 20 2 1
Explaination: 
Minimum number of coins and notes needed 
to make 43. 

Example 2:

Input: N = 1000
Output: 500 500
Explaination: minimum possible notes
is 2 notes of 500.

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minPartition() which takes the value N as input parameter and returns a list of integers in decreasing order.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)

860. Lemonade Change
Easy

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]






Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
Example 2:

Input: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]
Output: false
Explanation: 
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.
 

Constraints:

1 <= bills.length <= 105
bills[i] is either 5, 10, or 20.

class Solution {
    public boolean lemonadeChange(int[] bills) {
        
        int change5 = 0, change10 = 0, change20 = 0;

        for(int bill : bills){

            if(bill==5)change5++;
            else if(bill==10){
                if(change5>0){
                   change5--; 
                }
                else return false;
                change10++;
            }
            else{
                int changeNeeded = 15;
                while(changeNeeded>0 && change10>0){
                    change10--;
                    changeNeeded-=10;
                }
                while(changeNeeded>0 && change5>0){
                    change5--;
                    changeNeeded-=5;
                }
                if(changeNeeded>0)return false;
            }

        return true;

Solved

Hint
Given a string s containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', return true if s is valid.

The following rules define a valid string:

Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
'*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string "".
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "(*)"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(*))"
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s[i] is '(', ')' or '*'.

class Solution {
    public boolean checkValidString(String s) {
        int max = 0, min = 0;

        for(char ch : s.toCharArray()){
            if(ch == '('){
            min++;
            max++;
            }
            else if(ch==')'){
            min--;
            max--;
            if(min<0)min=0;

            }
            else{
                if(min-1>0)min=min-1;
                max++;

Minimum Platforms
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 26.84%Submissions: 553K+Points: 4
You are given the arrival times arr[] and departure times dep[] of all trains that arrive at a railway station on the same day. Your task is to determine the minimum number of platforms required at the station to ensure that no train is kept waiting.

At any given time, the same platform cannot be used for both the arrival of one train and the departure of another. Therefore, when two trains arrive at the same time, or when one arrives before another departs, additional platforms are required to accommodate both trains.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800], dep[] = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]

































Output: 3
Explanation: There are three trains during the time 9:40 to 12:00. So we need a minimum of 3 platforms.
Input: arr[] = [900, 1235, 1100], dep[] = [1000, 1240, 1200]
Output: 1
Explanation: All train times are mutually exclusive. So we need only one platform
Input: arr[] = [1000, 935, 1100], dep[] = [1200, 1240, 1130]
Output: 3
Explanation: All 3 trains have to be there from 11:00 to 11:30
Constraints:
1≤ number of trains ≤ 50000
0000 ≤ arr[i] ≤ dep[i] ≤ 2359
Note: Time intervals are in the 24-hour format(HHMM) , where the first two characters represent hour (between 00 to 23 ) and the last two characters represent minutes (this will be <= 59 and >= 0).
